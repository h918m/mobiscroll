The control can easily be customized to support any custom values and can even be used as an intuitive alternative to the native select control (dropdown list). It is designed to be used on touch devices as an alternative to the jQuery UI date picker.

The control is themable. You can easily change the appearance of if in CSS. It also comes with pre-defined, nice looking color schemes.

By default the control renders for intuitive and easy usage, but you can also customize it's parameters (width, height,...). For more info see the wiki.
